# Finding Nature
---------------------------------------------------
#### Assignment Date: 26th September 2019<br/>
#### Assignment Due: 17st October 2019 <br/>
-----------------------------------------------------
The project attempts to understand the documentation of nature throughout time in the collections of MET. It explores the tags given to each object for the project. It takes you on a ride to explore the elements of nature to finally see a set of relevant images <br/>

Method : html , .d3 , adobe illustrator, microsoft excel, .json <br/>

The process of the project is mentioned below. <br/>

#### 1. Understanding the tags <br/>
MET has attempted to tag each object with the relevant one or more tags. There are a total of 1066 unique tags. I used excel to seggregate the tags which had natural elements like landscape, sea, pigs etc. <br/>
![Understanding Tags](https://github.com/salonieshah/Major-Studio-1/blob/master/2.Finding_Nature/Images/Tags_Relational_Nature.jpg) <br/> 

Method: I created a html with d3 script to make a bubble diagram of all the tags MET had.<br/> 

After which I coloured grey to all the tags that did not contain natural elements <br/>

#### 2. Understanding the elements into larger groups <br/>
I understood the context of the tags and divided them into larger groups called i.e. flora, fauna, marine. Each group contains all the relevent tags. 

Once the user clicks the category it broadly shows the bubbles with contents of the catergory. For this exercise, I took an example of Fauna. Fauna gives the user to excess tags animals, birds, fish etc. <br/> 

#### 3. Understanding the each tag <br/> 
Once the user decides on the category, I intend to show all the actual tags that they can explore. For this exercise, I took an example of Insects. Insects gives the user to excess tags honeybee, insects, snails etc. <br/> 

#### 4. Indivisual Entities  <br/> 
After the user clicks on the indivisual insects, I intend to show a screen with a series of vectors. For this exercise, I took an example of Spiders. When the user clicks on the spider it intends to open an image of the artwork at MET <br/> 

#### 5. Doucmentation  <br/> 
 The below sketches were done before designing the code. I have attached all the relevent coding files and other conceptual sketches in the folders. <br/> 

### Other Attempts  <br/> 

I attempted to understand the timeline of documentation of insects. I also created a d3 bar chart for the same. I have attached the relevant in attemps folder. <br/> 

### Wishlist <br/> 
I wish I could explore more on the visual level and create a mock for physical visualization in the museum space.
