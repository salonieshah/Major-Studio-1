##### This is continuation of my [previous project.](https://github.com/salonieshah/Major-Studio-1/tree/master/1.Potrayal_of_Women_at_MET) <br>

### Research Question </br>
<b> How have women been represented, underrepresented, and misrepresented in European Portrait Paintings? </b> </br>
This visualization is inspired by the article “Images of Women in European Art” from John Berger’s book “Ways of Seeing”. The spectator-owners and painters of most of the European Portraits were male. The artists were usually commissioned by the wealthy male; to represent idealized versions of their loved one. Their perspective has skewed the portrayal of women in a large number of paintings. </br> </br>

### Interactive Visualization </br>
The visualization is based on the women portraits in the European Painting Department. The visualization segregates the paintings based on following categories. 
1. Time of Creation </br>
2. Artist Gender </br>
3. Subject Clothing </br>
4. Painting Backdrop </br>
5. Subject Eye-sight </br>
6. Subject Activity </br>

#### Characteristic </br>
1. The viewer can explore these categories to understand the comparisons between different sub categories. </br>
2. Each dot is one painting. </br>
3. The painting belonging to the dot is displayed in the circle on the right, when the user hovers over the dot.</br>
4. The dot changes its size to a larger dot helping the user to select specific paintings.</br>
5. Each dot links back to the webpage of the specific painting on the MET website. </br>

### Learnings </br>
1. 87% of portraits are painted by male artists.</br>
2. 6% of portraits are created by female artists—the perspective of women documenting women is missing.</br>
3. 0% of nude portraits are drawn by female artists.</br>
4. 30% of subjects are engaged in any sort of activity at all.</br>
5. 57% of portraits of women looking at the viewer and posing have unknown backgrounds.</br>
6. 65% of portraits of women engaged in activity are looking away from the view.</br>

### Methodology </br>
1. [HTML](https://github.com/salonieshah/Major-Studio-1/blob/master/3.Interactive/index.html) to create the webpage. </br> 
2. [CSS](https://github.com/salonieshah/Major-Studio-1/blob/master/3.Interactive/styles/styles.css) to stype the webpage. </br>
3. [jQuery](https://github.com/salonieshah/Major-Studio-1/blob/master/3.Interactive/interactive_1.js) to create the dropdown menu for interactive visualization. </br>
4. [d3](https://github.com/salonieshah/Major-Studio-1/blob/master/3.Interactive/interactive.js) for creating interactive visualization using d3 Bubble Chart and Force Diagram. </br>
5. [Github](https://github.com/salonieshah/Major-Studio-1/tree/master/3.Interactive) for hosting the webpage. </br>
