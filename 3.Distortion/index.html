            </p>
            <p class="explanation">
                This visualization is inspired by the article &ldquo;Images of Women in European Art&rdquo; from John Berger&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Ways of Seeing&rdquo;. The spectator-owners and painters of most of the European Portraits were male.  The artists were usually commissioned by the wealthy male; to represent idealized versions of their loved one. Their perspective has skewed the portrayal of women in a large number of paintings.
