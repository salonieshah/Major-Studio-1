### Research Question </br>
<b> How have women been represented, underrepresented, and misrepresented in European Portrait Paintings? </b> </br>
This visualization is inspired by the article “Images of Women in European Art” from John Berger’s book “Ways of Seeing”. The spectator-owners and painters of most of the European Portraits were male. The artists were usually commissioned by the wealthy male; to represent idealized versions of their loved one. Their perspective has skewed the portrayal of women in a large number of paintings. </br> </br>
